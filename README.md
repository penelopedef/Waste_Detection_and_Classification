## Background
The increasing volume of waste production in urban environments poses significant challenges for municipal waste management systems. 
With landfills nearing capacity and recycling rates lagging behind production, there is a critical need for innovative solutions to 
promote efficient waste sorting and recycling. While specific statistics may vary depending on the region and context, globally, urban 
areas generate substantial waste, with projections indicating a steady increase in waste production over the coming years. For instance, 
according to the World Bank, urban waste generation is expected to rise from 2.01 billion tonnes in 2016 to 3.40 billion tonnes by 2050 
(World Health Organization, 2024). Toronto's economy produces around 2.1 million tons of solid waste annually, with projections increasing 
to 2.5 million tons by 2030 if current trends persist (Circle Economy, 2022).

The motivation behind WasteWise Toronto is to leverage advanced machine learning and data science techniques to improve sorting accuracy,
thus enhancing recycling efforts and reducing the overall environmental footprint of urban waste management.
